# AUP Learning Cloud

AUP Learning Cloud is a tailored JupyterHub deployment designed to provide an intuitive and hands-on AI learning experience. It features a comprehensive suite of AI toolkits running on AMD hardware acceleration, enabling users to learn and experiment with ease.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to deploy AUP Learning Cloud on a single machine in a development or demo environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen™ AI Halo Device (e.g., AI Max+ 395, AI Max 390)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM (64GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Docker**: Install Docker and configure for non-root access

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply group changes without logout (or logout/login instead)
newgrp docker

# Install Build Tools
sudo apt install build-essential
```

> **Note**: See [Docker Post-installation Steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) and [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for details.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMDResearch/aup-learning-cloud.git
cd aup-learning-cloud
sudo ./auplc-installer install
```
After installation completes, open http://localhost:30890 in your browser. No login credentials are required - you will be automatically logged in.
The installer uses **Docker as the default container runtime** (`K3S_USE_DOCKER=1`), see more at [link](https://amdresearch.github.io/aup-learning-cloud/installation/single-node.html#runtime-and-mirror-configuration)


### Uninstall
```bash
sudo ./auplc-installer uninstall
```

> **💡 Tip**: For mirror configuration (registries, PyPI, npm), see [Mirror Configuration](deploy/README.md#mirror-configuration).

## Cluster Installation
For multi-node cluster installation or need more control over the deployment process:

- [Multi-Node Cluster Deployment](https://amdresearch.github.io/aup-learning-cloud/installation/multi-node.html) - Production deployment with Ansible playbooks

## Learning Solution

AUP Learning Cloud offers the following Learning Toolkits:

- [**Computer Vision**](projects/CV) \
Includes 10 hands-on labs covering common computer vision concepts and techniques.

- [**Deep Learning**](projects/DL) \
Includes 12 hands-on labs covering common deep learning concepts and techniques.

- [**Large Language Model from Scratch**](projects/LLM) \
Includes 9 hands-on labs designed to teach LLM development from scratch.

- [**Physical Simulation**](projects/PhySim) \
Hands-on labs for physics simulation and robotics using Genesis.

## Key Features

### Hardware Acceleration

AUP Learning Cloud provides a multi-user Jupyter notebook environment with the following hardware acceleration:

- **AMD GPU**: Leverage ROCm for high-performance deep learning and AI workloads.
- **AMD NPU**: Utilize Ryzen™ AI for efficient neural processing unit tasks.
- **AMD CPU**: Support for general-purpose CPU-based computations.

### Flexible Deployment

Kubernetes provides a robust infrastructure for deploying and managing JupyterHub. We support both single-node and multi-node K3s cluster deployments.

### Authentication

Seamless integration with GitHub Single Sign-On (SSO) and Native Authenticator for secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Auto-admin on install**: Initial admin created automatically with random password
- **Dual login**: GitHub OAuth + Native accounts on single login page
- **Batch user management**: CSV/Excel-based bulk operations via scripts

### Storage Management and Security

Dynamic NFS provisioning ensures scalable and persistent storage for user data, while end-to-end TLS encryption with automated certificate management guarantees secure and reliable communication.

## Available Notebook Environments

Current environments are configured via `custom.resources.images` in `runtime/values.yaml`. These settings should be consistent with `prePuller.extraImages`.

| Environment | Image                                    | Hardware                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Base CPU    | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-default` | CPU                             |
| GPU Base    | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-base`   | GPU                             |
| CV COURSE   | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-cv`    | GPU |
| DL COURSE   | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-dl`    | GPU |
| LLM COURSE  | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-llm`   | GPU                |
| PhySim COURSE | `ghcr.io/amdresearch/auplc-physim` | GPU               |
