# AUP Learning Cloud

AUP Learning Cloud is a tailored JupyterHub deployment designed to provide an intuitive and hands-on AI learning experience. It features a comprehensive suite of AI toolkits running on AMD hardware acceleration, enabling users to learn and experiment with ease.

![Software Architecture](docs/imgs/software-stack.png)


## Quick Start

The simplest way to deploy AUP Learning Cloud on a single machine in a development or demo environment.

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen™ AI Halo Device (e.g., AI Max+ 395, AI Max 390)
- **Memory**: 32GB+ RAM (64GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Docker**: Install Docker and configure for non-root access

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Apply group changes without logout (or logout/login instead)
newgrp docker

# Install Build Tools
sudo apt install build-essential
```

> **Note**: See [Docker Post-installation Steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) and [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for details.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMDResearch/aup-learning-cloud.git
cd aup-learning-cloud
sudo ./auplc-installer install
```

After installation completes, open http://localhost:30890 in your browser. No login credentials are required - you will be automatically logged in.

The installer uses **Docker as the default container runtime** (`K3S_USE_DOCKER=1`), so images you build locally (e.g. `img build hub`) are visible to K3s after `rt upgrade` without exporting or restarting. For offline or containerd-based deployment, use `K3S_USE_DOCKER=0 ./auplc-installer install`.

### Script Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `install` | Full installation (K3s, tools, GPU plugin, images, JupyterHub) |
| `uninstall` | Complete removal of all components |
| `install-tools` | Install Helm and K9s only |
| `rt install` | Deploy JupyterHub runtime only |
| `rt upgrade` | Upgrade JupyterHub (e.g. after `values.yaml` changes) |
| `rt reinstall` | Uninstall then install (e.g. after container image changes) |
| `rt remove` | Remove JupyterHub runtime |
| `img build` | Build all custom images |
| `img build [target...]` | Build specific images (e.g. `img build hub`, `img build hub cv`). Targets: `hub`, `base-cpu`, `base-gfx1151`, `cv`, `dl`, `llm`, `physim` |
| `img pull` | Pull external images for offline use |

Examples:
```bash
# Upgrade JupyterHub after configuration changes
sudo ./auplc-installer rt upgrade

# Rebuild only the hub image and apply (Docker mode)
sudo ./auplc-installer img build && sudo ./auplc-installer rt reinstall
```

Legacy long forms are still supported: `install-runtime`, `upgrade-runtime`, `remove-runtime`, `build-images`, `pull-images`.

- [Multi-Node Cluster Deployment](deploy/README.md#multi-node-cluster-deployment) - Production deployment with Ansible playbooks

## Learning Solution

AUP Learning Cloud offers the following Learning Toolkits:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only [**Deep Learning**](projects/DL) and [**Large Language Model from Scratch**](projects/LLM) are available in the v1.0 release.

- [**Computer Vision**](projects/CV) \
Includes 10 hands-on labs covering common computer vision concepts and techniques.

- [**Deep Learning**](projects/DL) \
Includes 12 hands-on labs covering common deep learning concepts and techniques.

- [**Large Language Model from Scratch**](projects/LLM) \
Includes 9 hands-on labs designed to teach LLM development from scratch.

## Key Features

### Hardware Acceleration

AUP Learning Cloud provides a multi-user Jupyter notebook environment with the following hardware acceleration:

- **AMD GPU**: Leverage ROCm for high-performance deep learning and AI workloads.
- **AMD NPU**: Utilize Ryzen™ AI for efficient neural processing unit tasks.
- **AMD CPU**: Support for general-purpose CPU-based computations.

### Flexible Deployment

Kubernetes provides a robust infrastructure for deploying and managing JupyterHub. We support both single-node and multi-node K3s cluster deployments.

### Authentication

Seamless integration with GitHub Single Sign-On (SSO) and Native Authenticator for secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Auto-admin on install**: Initial admin created automatically with random password
- **Dual login**: GitHub OAuth + Native accounts on single login page
- **Batch user management**: CSV/Excel-based bulk operations via scripts

### Storage Management and Security

Dynamic NFS provisioning ensures scalable and persistent storage for user data, while end-to-end TLS encryption with automated certificate management guarantees secure and reliable communication.

## Available Notebook Environments

Current environments are set up as `RESOURCE_IMAGES` in `runtime/chart/files/hub`. These settings should be consistent with `Prepullers` in `runtime/values.yaml`.

| Environment | Image                                    | Version | Hardware                        |
